        <h2>Peculiar Muskox Inc.</h2>
        <p>Have you ever heard of truffle-sniffing pigs? Well we use very strange muskoxen in a similar fashion to find magic beans! We were founded by the wizard who gave Jack the beans that grew into a magic beanstalk, and we are now selling to the public!</p>
        <p>Our founding wizard used a peculiar breed of muskoxen, who can sniff up these magic beans buried in the ground! These special beans, found by our peculiar muskoxen, will take you up to the tippy-top of the world! Meet and greet giants, and learn about their walk of life!</p>
        <p class="small-text">(Peculair Muskox Inc. is not liable for any injuries from giants, falling off magic beanstalks, or falling out of the clouds)</p>
