        <p>I am trying to write something random with <u>lack of sleep</u>. It is almost 5pm ad I have not slept. I am tired. I am creating a crappy website. I just want to see if this gets to the end. There are no requirements for this assignment except the bad stuff so I hope this is ok. I love writing. I am tired. I like the number 2042 and I can snap without using my thumbsa, Try thsat, but please don't adctually be able to otherwise I don;t think I'd be as cool. Like, if we went to a party and had to do party tricks and you did it before me, what am I supposed to do? That's my thing, so don't steal it. I hereby copyright it. Idk if thats how it works. But don';t do it. Seriously. I am playing Plants vs Zombies. </p>
