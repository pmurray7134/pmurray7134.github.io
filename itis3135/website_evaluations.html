            <h3><a href="https://www.discountbedsbelfast.co.uk/">Discount Beds Belfast</a></h3>
            
            <p>This is probably the worst design for a website I've ever seen. This site is designed to sell bedframes (I think, its really hard to tell). Its ugle, there are like a trillion heading menus, and the layout makes it very hard to comprehend what's going on. </p>
            <ul>
                <li>C - Contrast: Color has no meaning, and every shape is just a rectangle. </li>
                <li>R - Repetition: There is no descernable pattern or structure to this site. It is a mess of random ideas with no clear way to understand it without becoming an English teacher and studying shakespeare for at least ten years. </li>
                <li>A - Alignment: All text is aligned to the center, and either edge of this site has a bunch of unused space. </li>
                <li>P - Proximity: Everything is very far from related topics, and the most important function for a site like this (searching) is at the very bottom of the page. </li>
            </ul>
        </section>

            <h3><a href="https://open.spotify.com/">Spotify</a></h3>
            
            <p>Spotify is a music streaming service allowing users to intuitively listen to music. While not necessarily perfect, Spotify's design is well thought out to allow user to do whatever they could want to easily.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C - Contrast: Hovering over icons changes the background color and makes those icons larger. Different shapes mean different things (ie. songs are squares and artists are circles). </li>
                <li>R - Repetition: There is a well developed pattern, as each song is a square. </li>
                <li>A - Alignment: The whole site is properly aligned, allowing the most space possible on this site. </li>
                <li>P - Proximity: Everything needed is close together and easy to find. </li>
            </ul>
