            <h3>Review</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Submission was easy to access.</li>
                <li>File names are in correct format.</li>
                <li>The black characters can be hard to read, and contrast is pretty harsh. However, sizing and fonts are well done.</li>
                <li>Colors could be muted a bit, but fonts look good.</li>
                <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Very strong contrast, almost too much with the brighter colors.</li>
                <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Repetition is good.</li>
                <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> The section with images is not quite aligned, but looks good otherwise.</li>
                <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Proximity is good.</li>
                <li>Page has header, main, and footer, as well as a nav bar.</li>
                <li>Strong brand prescence with "Flesh and Blood" as the title.</li>
                <li>Main starts with page name as h2, does not include name of brand.</li>
                <li>No tagline in footer.</li>
                <li>Menu is in header, missing validation.</li>
                <li>Page meets the 5 page requirement of the assignment.</li>
            </ul>
